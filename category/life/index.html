A hamburger menu is always available for root-level navigation and all elements are kept large, touch-friendly, and readable. Subtle iconography and color is used to draw attention to important elements and differentiate options.

It’s written for Node.JS and uses a mongoDB database to store users, readings, sensor information, and various other data! It provides a REST API and, in addition to serving the static pages (the same ones available offline), it uses mustache templates to provide pages for content only accessible online.

To ensure the accountability of data while providing basic editing features, edits to sensor information are tracked using mongoDB middleware and made visible to users. These are just some examples of security considerations made during development.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1>What I Would Do Differently\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>First of all, revisiting this codebase after working in Python 3 primarily for a few years and getting used to type annotations and IntelliSense… ouch. Very frequently I have to trace the flow of control manually with \u003Ccode>console.log\u003C/code>s and a lot of reading. I would definitely switch to TypeScript nowadays as things would be much more navigable. However, there’s a lot of deeper issues than that. Some of these arose due to the simple passage of time: some libraries and tools get adopted and maintained, some don’t.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Firstly, lets address the use of Grunt. At the time of using it, it was relatively well-supported and I got used to it fairly quickly. The ability to mix JS scripting into your build system has a lot of benefits, though maybe a bit encouraging of hacky-ness. Nowadays, Grunt is pretty much dead. No releases in 2 years, and its mainly been surpassed by webpack. I’ve taken the hint and also begun migrating some of my older projects to webpack.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some issues, however, arose from my own inexperience. The biggest pill to swallow from this project is: it’s time to move on from jQuery and onto a proper framework. They’re infinitely less prone to breaking, with less time spent programming destructor functions and chasing bugs. jQuery’s purpose still feels mostly limited to small sites that need some dumb small feature quick and you don’t wanna deal with the poor syntax of vanilla JS, which between TS IntelliSense and AI code suggestions isn’t really even a problem anymore.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Which leads to the root of that issue: \u003Cem>lcatDB did not originally plan to be a SPA\u003C/em>. That was added after many of the pages were implemented and the code was written, so the SPA capabilities were hacked on top. jQuery does not suit itself well in this use case, but at the time I couldn’t justify the time as a single developer to go back and start from scratch. And with the scale of the project growing further in a small scope-creep, the problems from jQuery scaled up as well. Despite the amount of time I spent considering my options for libraries and platforms, the change in scope caused a pile-up of other issues. This was the single-biggest takeaway: nail down the entire set of specifications first, then implement. Be very specific and thorough. Even then, it’s still easier said than done; at the time I didn’t even know what questions to ask.\u003C/p>\n\n",fm:{title:"Retrospective: lcatDB",date:new Date(1684368000000),categories:"programming life software ui"}},{slug:"software-dump-multiplat",path:"/articles/software-dump-multiplat",code:"\u003Cscript context=\"module\">\n\texport const metadata = {\"title\":\"The Software Dump Part 2: Multiplatform\",\"date\":\"2023-04-11T00:00:00.000Z\",\"categories\":\"software life multiplatform\",\"last_modified_at\":\"2023-04-11T00:00:00.000Z\",\"comments\":true};\n\tconst { title, date, categories, last_modified_at, comments } = metadata;\n\u003C/script>\n\u003Cscript lang=\"ts\">\n    import Link from \"$lib/Link.svelte\";\n\u003C/script>\n\n\n\u003Cp>This is a continuation of my last post where I discussed programs exclusively for macOS.

There are many great ideas for products, but without a efficient plan, many of them lie on the table or the cutting-room floor.

I prioritize compatibility with IntelliSense, which makes any codebase significantly more navigable.

It’s nice to be able to write everything in markdown, and the default templates are pretty simple and lightweight. \u003Cdel>Right now the only JS dependency is jQuery, we’ll see if it stays that way.\u003C/del> \u003Cem>EDIT 2/11/23: Removed jQuery. ;)\u003C/em> Will probably at least add a lightbox plugin for images, eventually.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My site was previously written using Hexo, and while it got close to what I wanted, it was one of those things that was just non-mainstream enough that I could never get back into the flow of setting up a dev environment so that I could actually get to the writing. Lets hope this time goes a bit better!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My previous website designs very heavily followed Material Design. I wanted to try something a bit more unique with this new site. I’ve taken inspiration from a few places:\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Windows 98/XP\u003C/h3>\n\u003CFigure align=\"right\">\n    \u003CImage src={imgWin98Logo} />\n    \u003CImage src={imgXPMCE} />\n\u003C/Figure>\n\u003Cp>Most people referencing this would just throw on a vaporwave skin, maybe sprinkle a few Arizona cans and Evangelion renders here and there. I wanted to be a bit more subtle. The main font for titles and headers is Franklin Gothic, lifted straight from the Windows 98 logo. In its black weight, it’s very pleasing to look at while remaining readable. The main font for content is MS Sans Serif, which was used in the Windows 98 UI. I’m not 100% set on it right now but I figure its a nice callback. I tried Tahoma at one point (Windows XP UI font) but it’s a bit too playful for my taste; gets kinda obnoxious to look at.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The background elements also call back to the design of Windows Media Center, which was included with the first PC my parents’ bought new for me.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>iOS\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Well, not exclusive to iOS, but certain elements of the site have a frosted glass touch to them. It’s subtle with the mostly-black background, but adds some nice flair.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>“The 70’s”\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Bold text, bold colors, simple designs. No references to the era specifically, just kinda lifting the general vibe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Life\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Orange is my favorite color. Wife’s favorite color bounces between sky blue and pastel pink. Our wedding colors were orange and pink. Nuff’ said.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>What’s with the dice?\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Needed a background element to go with the XPMCE thing. I was demoing this aesthetic on a custom startpage, and I figured it’d be fun to make it something randomized. At the same time, I wanted it to have a utilitarian purpose, so if I ever need a quick dice roll, I can just open a new tab! I’ve carried it over here, but might switch it in the future.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Going Forward\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>I want to spend more time doing things that bring me instrinsic happiness. Will writing in this blog be one of them? Who knows! But I’ll make an effort to keep up. Before I move onto the future, I’ll be transferring some content from my old site, doing some write-ups and reflections on my past few years of projects/life stuff, and having a bit of fun.\u003C/p>\n\n",fm:{title:"New Blog?",date:new Date(1667779200000),last_modified_at:new Date(1676073600000),categories:"meta life design ui",comments:true}},{slug:"photo-megapost",path:"/articles/photo-megapost",code:"\u003Cscript context=\"module\">\n\texport const metadata = {\"title\":\"Photography Megapost\",\"date\":\"2022-11-07T00:00:00.000Z\",\"categories\":\"life photography\",\"comments\":true};\n\tconst { title, date, categories, comments } = metadata;\n\u003C/script>\n\u003Cscript lang=\"ts\">\n\nimport { type GalleryDescriptor } from \"$lib/Gallery\";\nimport Gallery from '$lib/Gallery.svelte';\n\nexport let data;\n\nconst galleries = [\n    {\n        name: \"January 2019\",\n        description: \"Point Au Roche\",\n        images: data.galleries[\"jan-2019-point-au-roche\"],\n        thumbs: import.meta.glob('./jan-2019-point-au-roche/*.jpg', {\n            eager: true,\n            query: { w: 160, h: 160, fit: 'cover', as: 'run' }\n        })\n    },\n    {\n        name: \"Summer 2018\",\n        description: \"Some miscellaneous photos taken during my time working at the Whiteface ASRC in 2018.\",\n        images: data.galleries[\"summer-2018-whiteface\"],\n        thumbs: import.meta.glob('./summer-2018-whiteface/*.jpg', {\n            eager: true,\n            query: { w: 160, h: 160, fit: 'cover', as: 'run' }\n        })\n    },\n    {\n        name: \"Summer 2018 (Night)\",\n        description: \"During the summer of 2018, I was given the opportunity to spend the night on the summit of Whiteface.
