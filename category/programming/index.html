It started when I had a fleet of student devices to deploy as a Research Assistant in grad school. I had already considered plenty of other solutions before rolling my own:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Deploy a disk image\u003C/strong>: I did end up using this when deploying a bunch of devices at the same time, and it works great when you want everything to have the same stuff. But you will run into collisions with hostnames and other identifiers. For what most people are reading this article for, this isn’t viable.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>MDM Solutions\u003C/strong>: Our program did not have the funds for this, otherwise I might’ve tried it. A good solution for managing a fleet, but not so much for personal installs.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Customized Install Media\u003C/strong>: In the context of debloating, this will probably bring memories of TinyXP/10/11. I think it’s clear from their attempts, however impressive they are, that they are NOT the way forward. They’re difficult to audit as safe (\u003Ca\n  href=\"https://github.com/ntdevlabs/tiny11builder\"\n  rel=\"nofollow\"\n>except Tiny11\u003C/a>), difficult to maintain, quickly fall behind in support, and often break updates and other features. You won’t be picking and choosing what you want, you’ll be accepting a very set-in-stone preset that you’ll be committing to (and then distrohopping away from). Oh, and in the context of deploying devices, it’s a pain in the ass there too.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Debloat Scripts and Tools\u003C/strong>: Right, so this is what I settled on. So lets get into this more.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch1>Why So Complicated\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>There are probably hundreds of Windows debloat tools out there at this point. I’m not going to even try to list them all. But there’s been some patterns I’ve noticed that feel very counterproductive:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>GUI Debloaters\u003C/strong>: I’m not gonna mince words here: \u003Cem>if you make a GUI for your debloater, I think you are wasting your time.\u003C/em> I’m only ever gonna run this thing once when I install Windows. The development effort of maintaining a GUI should be saved for software people are going to interact with on a regular basis. And the quality of most of these programs reflects this: their tweaks tend to break random stuff that they shouldn’t, have insane defaults, and don’t get updated as much as they should.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Maintaining tweaks you don’t even use\u003C/strong>: I can tell a lot of the tweaks in debloaters aren’t actually being used by the people maintaining and distributing them. Ironically, this actually ends up bloating the debloaters with yet more shit that doesn’t work and wasting even more of peoples’ time. I’m not going to claim my debloater is perfect with this but 99% of everything in it I use on a daily basis.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>MacroTweaks\u003C/strong>: Each tweak should have a very limited scope. A couple registry keys or commands that do one thing and one thing only. I want to disable Defender, not my firewall (I’m looking at you \u003Ca\n  href=\"https://privacy.sexy/\"\n  rel=\"nofollow\"\n>privacy.sexy\u003C/a>).\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch1>MiniWinDeploy: A Simple Basis\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>That leads me to the first part of my debloat empire: \u003Ca\n  href=\"https://github.com/heyjoeway/miniwindeploy\"\n  rel=\"nofollow\"\n>MiniWinDeploy\u003C/a>.

It runs executables and applies “tweak files” in the way that makes the most sense for unattended use. The script is 331 LOC that hasn’t been touched in over 2 years. Which is a good thing, because it still works perfect. All of the actual tweaks are kept in a separate repository…\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1>JoeyDebloat\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Despite the name “JoeyDebloat” the repo has turned into more of a tweak compilation. However, I think these tweaks will be welcomed by most, and for those who aren’t pleased with what it does will instead be pleased by how easy it is to modify.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some will be familiar with the \u003Ccode>irm | iex\u003C/code> Powershell pattern that allows scripts to be hosted at a URL and be quickly executed with a one-liner. Probably the Most famous example are the \u003Ca\n  href=\"https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts\"\n  rel=\"nofollow\"\n>Microsoft Activation Scripts\u003C/a>.

It then clones this repo (JoeyDebloat) and opens it in File Explorer. From there, change whatever scripts you’d like, then open Start.bat.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>To be clear, when this script has finished running the only thing it will have done is install the aforementioned programs. No debloating/tweaking has been done yet. It will open file explorer, but before clicking \u003Ccode>Start.bat\u003C/code> you may want to explore the \u003Ccode>All\u003C/code> folder to see what exactly it’s going to do to your system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is the best part about this approach: if you don’t like a tweak, you just delete it. It uses your existing knowledge of using file explorer to subvert the need for a GUI. On the other side, if I ever want to add a tweak, I can just drop it into the repo as a file. And if you want to stay posted with what I’ve been changing, \u003Ca\n  href=\"https://github.com/heyjoeway/joeydebloat/commits/main/\"\n  rel=\"nofollow\"\n>you can just check the commit history\u003C/a>.

Well, if I listed everything we’d be here for hours and I’m also not gonna keep this article up to date. I was gonna do a brief overview but I don’t even think that’s worth it. \u003Ca\n  href=\"https://github.com/heyjoeway/joeydebloat/tree/main/All\"\n  rel=\"nofollow\"\n>Each tweak is titled with a description of what it will do\u003C/a>, and to make things a bit easier to parse I’ve moved the more opinionated tweaks into separate folders. The general pattern is this: make Windows as quiet and well-behaved as possible, then add programs that I’m bound to download eventually.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You may have come to this article with the express interest of seeing what the debloat actually does. I think for people really interested in doing this, knowing how to efficiently maintain a tweak library themselves is going to be significantly more useful than relying on some random dude with no incentive to tailor their tweaks to everyone’s lifestyle.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1>:fork:\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>So you want to add your own tweaks.

One element that I take pride in across most of my projects is responsive CSS, allowing for automatic adaptations to mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts.\u003C/p>\n\u003CFigure>\n    \u003CVideo src={vidResponsive} />\n\u003C/Figure>\n\u003Cp>lcatDB’s client was built using several JavaScript libraries, frameworks, and related tools, including:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Grunt (build system)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Cordova (Android/iOS builds)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>jQuery\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Bootstrap\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Leaflet\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Mustache (for page templating)\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>The client is structured as a SPA, and thus can run offline (albeit with some restrictions). An event queue was added to allow for offline operations to be uploaded to the server later, which was a required use-case due to poor cell service in the middle of the lake. Below is a video demo of various features and interactions!\u003C/p>\n\u003CFigure>\n    \u003CVideo src={vidPages} />\n\u003C/Figure>\n\u003Ch1>Server-Side\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>The server is probably the least interesting to talk about, but still quite important! It’s written for Node.JS and uses a mongoDB database to store users, readings, sensor information, and various other data! It provides a REST API and, in addition to serving the static pages (the same ones available offline), it uses mustache templates to provide pages for content only accessible online. I’ll talk more about this system later and my thoughts on its use.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Passwords are stored as bcrypt hashes for essential user security. Users authenticate using \u003Ca\n  href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/12/using-secure-client-side-sessions-to-build-simple-and-scalable-node-js-applications-a-node-js-holiday-season-part-3/\"\n  rel=\"nofollow\"\n>client sessions\u003C/a> which can be invalidated (logged out) server-side in case of certain user actions (eg. password resets). To ensure the accountability of data while providing basic editing features, edits to sensor information are tracked using mongoDB middleware and made visible to users. These are just some examples of security considerations made during development.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1>What I Would Do Differently\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>First of all, revisiting this codebase after working in Python 3 primarily for a few years and getting used to type annotations and IntelliSense… ouch. Very frequently I have to trace the flow of control manually with \u003Ccode>console.log\u003C/code>s and a lot of reading. I would definitely switch to TypeScript nowadays as things would be much more navigable. However, there’s a lot of deeper issues than that. Some of these arose due to the simple passage of time: some libraries and tools get adopted and maintained, some don’t.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Firstly, lets address the use of Grunt. At the time of using it, it was relatively well-supported and I got used to it fairly quickly. The ability to mix JS scripting into your build system has a lot of benefits, though maybe a bit encouraging of hacky-ness. Nowadays, Grunt is pretty much dead. No releases in 2 years, and its mainly been surpassed by webpack. I’ve taken the hint and also begun migrating some of my older projects to webpack.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some issues, however, arose from my own inexperience. The biggest pill to swallow from this project is: it’s time to move on from jQuery and onto a proper framework. They’re infinitely less prone to breaking, with less time spent programming destructor functions and chasing bugs. jQuery’s purpose still feels mostly limited to small sites that need some dumb small feature quick and you don’t wanna deal with the poor syntax of vanilla JS, which between TS IntelliSense and AI code suggestions isn’t really even a problem anymore.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Which leads to the root of that issue: \u003Cem>lcatDB did not originally plan to be a SPA\u003C/em>. That was added after many of the pages were implemented and the code was written, so the SPA capabilities were hacked on top. jQuery does not suit itself well in this use case, but at the time I couldn’t justify the time as a single developer to go back and start from scratch. And with the scale of the project growing further in a small scope-creep, the problems from jQuery scaled up as well. Despite the amount of time I spent considering my options for libraries and platforms, the change in scope caused a pile-up of other issues. This was the single-biggest takeaway: nail down the entire set of specifications first, then implement. Be very specific and thorough. Even then, it’s still easier said than done; at the time I didn’t even know what questions to ask.\u003C/p>\n\n",fm:{title:"Retrospective: lcatDB",date:new Date(1684368000000),categories:"programming life software ui",last_modified_at:"2024-12-04T14:57:02-05:00"}},{slug:"responsive-design",path:"/articles/responsive-design",code:"\u003Cscript context=\"module\">\n\texport const metadata = {\"title\":\"Responsive Design Showcase\",\"date\":\"2023-05-18T00:00:00.000Z\",\"categories\":\"programming ui design\",\"last_modified_at\":\"2023-05-19T00:00:00.000Z\"};\n\tconst { title, date, categories, last_modified_at } = metadata;\n\u003C/script>\n\u003Cscript lang=\"ts\">\n    import Image from \"$lib/Image.svelte\";\n    import Video from \"$lib/Video.svelte\";\n    import Figure from \"$lib/Figure.svelte\";\n\n    import vidWhiteface from \"./Whiteface Responsive Demo.mp4\";\n    import vidLcatDB from \"./lcatDB Responsive Demo.mp4\";\n    import vidHeyjoeway from \"./heyjoeway Responsive Demo.mp4\";\n\u003C/script>\n\n\u003Cp>Here’s a mainly visual showcase of some of my work in responsive design!\u003C/p>\n\u003CFigure>\n    \u003CVideo src={vidWhiteface} />\n    \u003Cfigcaption slot=\"caption\">The Whiteface Tour is a 360-degree virtual tour of the Whiteface Mountain summit I developed using three.js. \u003Ca href=\"https://jojudge.com/whitefacetour\">Try it for yourself here!\u003C/a>\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/Figure>\n\u003CFigure>\n    \u003CVideo src={vidLcatDB} />\n    \u003Cfigcaption slot=\"caption\">lcatDB was a full-stack single-page application which I developed. \u003Ca href=\"/articles/lcatdb\">You can read more about it here.\u003C/a>\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/Figure>\n\u003CFigure>\n    \u003CVideo src={vidHeyjoeway} />\n    \u003Cfigcaption slot=\"caption\">And last but not least, the site you're reading this on!

Twenty. Four. It’s based on Doom of all things (can’t recall which source port off the top of my head) and is unexpectedly super fun to play. I’ve followed the game since I was probably like 7 or 8 and wanted a portable version ever since. At the time I ported it, the best options were to play it on something like a GPD Win, OpenPandora, or a PSP, all pretty lacking consoles for the modern age. This was also before an Android or iOS port.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>carstene1ns was responsible for the original port. They released a proof-of-concept port that ran at a pretty terrible framerate. I decided to attempt building their port myself, and found that the poor framerate wasn’t their fault at all. In the time between our builds, the Switch port of SDL2 had been updated to where it just… worked. So, I picked up maintenance of the port and added some more quality of life things:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Internet connectivity\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Fixed on accident while adding nxlink support!\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>On-screen keyboard support\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Ability to run in background (to avoid people essentially lag-switching servers)\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>In addition to C programming, these ports required knowledge of SDL2, libnx, and GNU Make. At the time, I had limited knowledge of each. By the time I was done, I became fairly affluent in each. Learning to read through git history to pick out breaking changes was an essential skill needed to accomplish this as well. All in all, it was a great learning experience and the gateway to all my other ports.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>My only big regret was that I never got GL working.

At this point, the DevkitPro Switch portlibs had matured to the point where I could mostly just create a Makefile for them and they were good to go.
