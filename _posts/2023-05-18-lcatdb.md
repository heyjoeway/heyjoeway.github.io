lcatDB (Lake Champlain Anglers' Temperature Database) was an online database and PWA meant to provide a centralized means of recording, accessing, and analyzing vertical water temperature profiles to citizens of the Lake Champlain region. It was supported by the SUNY Plattsburgh Center for Earth & Environmental Science and the Lake Champlain Sea Grant. lcatDB was (what I consider to be) my first attempt at mid-scale software development. While the app never really took off and is no longer around today, I was able to demonstrate many of my strengths and learned several valuable lessons.

# User Interface

The UI of lcatDB very closely follows Google's (now aged) Material Design guidelines. A hamburger menu is always available for root-level navigation and all elements are kept large, touch-friendly, and readable. Subtle iconography and color is used to draw attention to important elements and differentiate options. One element that I take pride in across most of my projects is responsive CSS, allowing for automatic adaptations to mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts.
