i want to be enthralled by open source stuff as much as everyone else but i gotta be honest, obsidian at its best is still worse than notion at its worst. and the gap is BIG.

biggest problems:
- i am not paying $4/month to sync my notes, especially if that number could go up. i would rather waste time building my own app than pay monthly for something as basic as notes.
- the obsidian livesync plugin is buggy and whiny. and its still the best free sync obsidian has.
- git syncing is such a pain in the ass, don't even bother.
- databases? I'm sure you could hack something together with dataview and templater, god knows i tried. prepare to spend hours on something notion has an actual system for.

I'm coming out of this completely disillusioned with obsidian. i do not understand the hype and i think a lot of people are singing its praises only to justify their own sunk cost
