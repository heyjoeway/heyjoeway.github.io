to all the people saying that it's zoomers' fault they are worse with tech: i just tried to copy the recipients from an email in outlook and paste it to the invitees on a new calendar event, and it couldn't even do that without breaking. (it then proceeded to ask for my location) i think "zoom bad at tech" is at least partially another case of gen z being passed down worse circumstances to live their life and being blamed for it
