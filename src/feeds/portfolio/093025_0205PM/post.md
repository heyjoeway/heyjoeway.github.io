The site that you're reading right now is entirely Svelte-based. What you're reading right now is a *static* build of the site. That means anything that would typically involve dynamic routing - such as articles and feeds - are instead compiled ahead of time so that the only hosting is for a directory of files. That is to say, there is no server-side code! For you that means a faster loading site. For me, that means not having to worry about keeping the server running, keeping it secure, and defending against intrusions.

However, at home I have a separate copy of the site running in *dynamic* mode, I get additional features for post management, which you can see in the picture below. This helps me make quick updates to the site when I'm out and about.

My only other major Svelte project at the moment is my Grocery app. I haven't talked about it too much publicly yet but you can read my most recent post about in the embed.
