As a hobby project, I ported several open-source games to the Nintendo Switch. This required a lot of deep-diving into the git history of other port projects to understand the process independently, which lead to a lot of experience with C/C++ and the GNU Make build system. I no longer maintain these projects, but they are still playable and you can learn more about the experience [here](/articles/switch-ports).
