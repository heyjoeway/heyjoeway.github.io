While working at Champlain Valley Educational Services, I lead the development and deployment of several internal databases and applications using the low-code app builder [Budibase](https://budibase.com/). This allowed me to prototype, iterate, and ship applications quickly while retaining enough flexibility to not run into dead ends.

Budibase was selected only after a thorough analysis of all available "app-builder" services with a preference for solutions which have options for remote hosting, self-hosting, HIPAA compliance, and are generally usable. [TODO: link to analysis]

Three applications I created replaced existing FileMaker databases with the goal being drop-in replacement. All of these applications have been deployed for at least 3 months with success.

Two original applications were also produced. The first was a simple inventory collection app for use with a barcode scanner. The second was an application to collect check-ins for a public vote on the CVES Capital Project land sale. This collected over 500 submissions and ensured that any duplicate names/addresses were prevented and made aware to staff. This was completed in a rapid iterative process with clients over a period of about 3 weeks.
