Grocery apps are generally terrible, unfocused, and made by people I'm convinced don't even shop for themselves. So I made one last weekend. 

It's designed to require as little interaction as possible so that I can get my thoughts stored and retrieved without getting distracted poking around ads and other clunky crap. Any new features will be designed to not bloat what is already a pretty good workflow. Also it live-syncs between devices and users.

Built with Svelte, Supabase, and Flowbite. Shoutout to [svupa](https://svupa.vercel.app) for being based.

Right now very early. No auth yet, but soon(tm). I will open source it after I'm happy with it but right now I have dollar sign eyes so licensing will have some (fair) twists. If I get there.
