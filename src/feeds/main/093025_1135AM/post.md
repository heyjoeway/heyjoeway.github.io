I figure I should give an update on the grocery app since I'm working on my portfolio! Its gotten a bit of a glow up and is feature complete for use with a single list. Multi-list and authentication is still a WIP, but since my wife and I have been so satisfied with it, that should be next on the menu. I've also Docker-ized it to make future hosting as simple as possible. The item emojis are generated using [KomeijiForce/bart-large-emojilm](https://huggingface.co/KomeijiForce/bart-large-emojilm), and while they're not always the most accurate, they're mainly there to visually break up the list and be easier on the eyes.
