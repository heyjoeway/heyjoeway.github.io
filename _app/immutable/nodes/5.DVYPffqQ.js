This was then used to type the words onto an SVG using Inkscape. A second SVG was used to make the borders for the letters.</p> <!> <p>These were then imported into Blender and extruded to make them 3D. Although the letters seem shallow in the final render, they are actually quite long. The letters were then given materials with appropriate colors.</p> <!> <p>The raw render out of Blender is as follows:</p> <!> <p>It’s lacking a lot of little details though. The letters have no gradients or sparkles, and the foreground graphic of Cappy is straight up missing. The final details were added in GIMP:</p> <!> <p>For comparison, here’s the original logo:</p> <!> <h2>Thoughts</h2> <p>There’s definitely a lot of things that could be improved here. The planet from the “O” in the original logo is completely missing. A lot of materials don’t look metallic enough. The borders don’t come down at the right angle and have gaps. Colors are a bit desaturated. The middle letters aren’t stretched enough and the top letters are too big. The Cappy graphic appears to be out of date (?). However, for something that was honestly just intended as a joke, I think it came out alright.</p> <h2>Download</h2> <p>If you’d like to download the original project file, you’re in luck!
