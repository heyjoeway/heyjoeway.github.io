The logo is modeled after the shape of the round-house and silo at the top of the mountain while also including key elements such as the shape of the mountain, the silhouette of the cloud collector, and the radio platform.</p> <!> <p>The font used is Josefin Sans and was mainly chosen due to its bold look and the distinct shape of its W.
